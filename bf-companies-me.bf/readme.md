# WHAT NEXT

This project can also be used to generate a lot of data to train a ML program, for fun, PoC or serious stuff
hope you try it some day.

There is a file named "scrap.html" that contains the whole text (for one item) from which data is extracted
by generating more of these we could have around 12 thousand files which can be used to play with ML.
