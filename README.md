# MyWebScrappers
A Collection of scripts to make my life (and maybe yours) easier.




# #1 A list of 12,000+ companies from me.bf
##### Including data like owner's name, captial amount, contacts...
This script will collect all entries from the url below
into one excel sheet, the data collected have been predefined, 
and can be edited directly into the code.

location: ./bf-companies-me.bf

## WHAT NEXT ?

This project can also be used to generate a lot of data to train a ML program, for fun, PoC or serious stuff
hope you try it some day.

There is a file named "scrap.html" that contains the whole text (for one item) from which data is extracted
by generating more of these we could have around 12 thousand files which can be used to play with ML.
